Prototype 1 is located in nn.py, which is a simple Keras neural network with one
hidden layer and default parameters. It's been trained on one country but
predictions are not reliable yet. For our next step, we will continue our
research, modify parameters and layers, and fine tune the predictions. 

In order to run the nn.py python script, you must have python 3.6. Furthermore, you
also have to install the packages inside the requirements.txt file. From the
command line, type "pip3 install -r requirements.txt".

The script outputs several different things, just focus on the output following
the KERAS headline. In the output, the prediction method returns which class the data
falls under, 1 for poor and 0 for not poor.
